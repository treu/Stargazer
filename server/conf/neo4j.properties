# Uncomment and specify these lines for running Neo4j in High Availability mode.
# ha.server_id is a unique integer for each instance of the Neo4j database in the cluster.
# (as opposed to the coordinator instance IDs)
# example: ha.server_id=1
ha.server_id=1

# ha.coordinators is a comma-separated list (without spaces) of the host:port of where to
# find one or more of the Neo4j coordinator servers.
# Avoid localhost due to IP resolution issues on some systems.
# example: ha.coordinators=localhost:2181,1.2.3.4:4321
ha.coordinators=127.0.0.1:2181

#You can make a database instance permanently slave-only by including the ha.slave_coordinator_update_mode=none configuration parameter in its configuration. Such instances will never become a master during fail-over elections though otherwise they behave identically to any other slaves, including the ability to write-through permanent slaves to the master.

# You can also, optionally, configure the ha.cluster_name. This is the name of the cluster this
# instance is supposed to join. Accepted characters are alphabetical, numerical, dot and dash. 
# This configuration is useful if you have multiple Neo4j HA clusters managed by the same
# Coordinator cluster.
# Example: ha.cluster_name = my.neo4j.ha.cluster
ha.cluster_name = blockviewer.cluster

# IP and port for this instance to bind to to communicate data with the
# other neo4j instances in the cluster. This is broadcasted to the other
# cluster members, so different members can have different communication ports.
#Optional if the members are on different machines so the IP is different for every member.
